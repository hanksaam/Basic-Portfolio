            Greetings! I am a budding web developer who is excited about the coding and the web development industry. I recently completed a 12-week coding bootcamp through Northwestern University and thoroughly enjoyed my education. During the intense, three-month, full-time program, I discovered an entire world about which I knew next to nothing. However, I quickly caught on to the art of coding and feel excited about applying the skills I mastered in an entry level position. Once hired, I look forward to continued learning and growth in this dynamic and ever-changing field. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I value the pursuit of furthering my education; during my previous career, I took it upon myself to pursue continuing education courses to develop skills that would increase my ability to help my employers and fulfill client needs. The courses I took covered the Microsoft Office suite including Access and Excel; these courses sparked my interest and passion for computers, programming, and data analytics. The ability to independently seek continuing education is paramount for any effective programmer. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Before I decided to make a career change, I had a 25 year work history in carpentry, construction, and environmental restoration fields, all of which require deliberate attention to detail, the ability to flexibly "zoom in and out" of the big picture down to the itemized particulars of a project, and the ability to both work in isolation and with a team to creatively solve problems. These skills, coupled with my notable work ethic, and commitment to furthering my education are directly transferrable to the tech field and will, no doubt, punctuate my ability to effectively fulfil any role for which I am hired.
