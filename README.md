# My-Portfolio
This is My Portfolio. 


This page started out as something much different. In the beginning, I had bits and pieces here and there, in very different places, that all had to come together in a certain way to become what it is now. This is the result. 
these are the technologies that I have used:
 html      
 css
 javascript
 jquery
 node
 mysql 
 sequelize
 firebase db
 mongodb
 handlebars
 ajax calls
 api's
 and many other technologies designed to enhance my skills as a developer.
 
Just like this page, I too will grow and build upon what I have learned so as to become the best developer I can. There's much to learn and much to do.
